STORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You were happy. You loved your family. You had an enviable job, a lovely home,
and fine friends. Like something out of a storybook, things were going well. Not
perfect, mind you, but very well indeed.

With time, things grew darker. You began to hear warnings. Invisible angels
spoke of things to come. None of it made much sense. The world kept turning, yet
somehow, you began to understand that Hell was imminent. You could feel it in
your bones.

You told your friends and family. None of them believed you. Crazy as it may
have sounded, none of them so much as *humored* you. They thought that you had
lost it; "family history" was mumbled behind your back.

They locked you away in a padded chamber. Surrounded by CHAMBERS. Everyone
called it "asylum", yet it felt more like a prison. "When Hell arrives, what
safer place than surrounded by the mad?" you sarcastically thought to yourself.

You awaken to blood-curdling screams. Flashes punctuate the darkness as ungodly
abominations growl, chasing the inmates, muffling their cries as they descend.
The warning were true. You are, in fact, the only one who can push Hell back
from this world.

If you fail, it could be the end of all...

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to play CHAMBERS, you need to own the *SILVER EDITION* of either a 
TI-83+ or TI-84+. If you do not own either of these models of calculator, you
can play the game using an emulator.

Wabbit is the recommended emulator - http://wabbit.codeplex.com/

*If the greyscale is flickery, try changing the display settings in your 
emulator to represent more shades of grey.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use TI Connect (or the connectivity software of your choice) to transfer
CHAMBERS.8xp to your calculator.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING "CHAMBERS"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To play, an ION-compatible shell is required.
Chambers has been tested using Ion, MirageOS, and DoorsCS.

While I have encountered no issues, MirageOS is *not* recommended
due to the potential for conflicts while running.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMEPLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAMBERS is not intended to be an easy game. Every playthrough is different.
The odds are stacked against you. Monsters are randomly generated according to
certain rules of the game, and not all monsters of the same type are equal.

Be wary!

HOW TO PLAY A ROGUELIKE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAMBERS is about constraints. With your small inventory, limited mobility, and
multiple challenges and obstacles, you must wisely manage your inventory and
carefully plan your movement, attack, and defense strategy with every turn.

You will fail while playing CHAMBERS. You will fail far more than you succeed.
This is because CHAMBERS is a roguelike. Failure is fun. Failure is learning.
Victory is therefore made all-the-sweeter. Remember that *nearly* every single
game created is able to be completed if you make the right choices.

Some suggestions for enjoying your experience of CHAMBERS as a roguelike:

	****Locked doors save lives!****

	Try experimenting with items / item combinations. You might find that
	some things work better in some situations or have a second purpose.

	If your gameplay strategy always leads to the same types of failure,
	you should try doing something different. Experiment!

	Before moving, think about how to best complete each room.

	Think about how items may be used in conjunction with one-another, or,
	which items you may want to use and the best order of consumption.

	Remember, multiple strategies can accomplish the same results!

	Think about which items you want to save versus which items are 
	expendable. When you fail, think about what items you had in your
	inventory and whether you would have fared better had you been
	more or less conservative in your use of items.

	Be wary of monsters at higher levels. Pay attention to how much
	damage each individual monster deals to you during any given
	combat session. Monsters of the same type may still vary!

	Blindly attacking for multiple turns is a sure way to lose! Pause
	after every attack in case you need to reassess your situation.

In order to succeed, you must reach the final level and confront the great
evil that you find there. I cannot tell you how to accomplish this. Upon
discovering where the last level lurks, you will want to plan your strategy.
Multiple strategies can accomplish the same results!
