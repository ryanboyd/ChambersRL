Flare should destroy all ghosts!

give monsters special abilities
	one monster will destroy a random inventory item when it attacks (50% chance maybe) -- DONE

	
Room ideas:
	a room where YOU are invisible --NOPE
	a room that heals you up to max normal health (if you have enough rooms that are rough enough, maybe make it rare)
	a room (or item) where you can walk through stuff (but not hit anything?) -- NOPE


Make the SPEED last 6 turns, allowing monsters to move if Turn^2 <> 0 -- DONE
Make the Alpha Button shout out a "spell" (only works once per floor if items appear) -- MAYBE
	-has a small chance of making the monsters freeze for a turn (speed) 
	-has a small chance of making an item appear
or make alpha Fire something for damage -- MAYBE
	third spot below HP and LEVEL
	count of "rocks" or whatever you throw
	have to figure out where the closest monster is, or just have them hit the arrow key


going to cap level at 25 (250 HP cap)
no monsters can be higher than 25 exp points (Strength)
starting at level 23, any experience over 225 MUST be what takes you to the next level
room obviously must cap at 255


random messages when entering room (maybe during combat)
	-"the demon bellows 'get him!'"
mental hospital theme
	you get locked up for being crazy, you think that hell is taking over
	then, while locked up, it happens
		(or so it appears to your character)
		at the end, turns out, you really were crazy
			you were killing people the whole time

maybe add "boss stages" if there's enough space
	badass that takes up two or four spaces, can't avoid him



For attack, try rand%(lvl^1.15)+(lvl^.75)

(C+L1) = actual items on map
(C+L1) + 112 = 0's and 1's to make sure monster doesn't move multiple times per turn
(C+L1) + 224 = monster HP
(C+L1) + 336 = monster lvl (and EXP value)


L2(1) = Room
L2(2) = Experience points
L2(3) = HP

L2(5) = getkey value
L2(6) = cursor location
L2(7) = character pos x
L2(8) = character pox y
L2(9) = message number
L2(10) = Temporarily hold monster in case you move it
L2(11) = Temporarily hold monster's HP in case you move it
L2(12) = character level
L2(13) = Bezerker (0=no, 1-5 = yes)
L2(14) = has monster moved yet? (0=no, anything else = yes)
L2(15) = temporarily hold a monster's level in case you move it
L2(16) = contrast
L2(17) = new room generate? 0 = no, 1 = yes
L2(18-22) = inventory
L2(23) = just cleared out of inventory (1 = yes, 0 = no, 2=yes, but used an item)
L2(24) = darkness? 20 = yes, 0 = no
L2(25) = already locked the door? 0 = no, 1 = yes
L2(26) = speed? 0 = no, 1-3 = yes
L2(27) = gas room? 20 = yes, everything else = no
L2(28) = progress text? 1 = yes, 0 = no
L2(29) = final boss placed? 1 = yes, 0 = no
L2(30) = endgame? 1 = yes, 0 = no
L2(31) = number of minions
L2(32) = ghost gen position
L2(33) = monster generated on this level? 0 = no, anything else = yes
L2(34) = first launching the game? 1 = yes, 0 = no
L2(35) = number of doors locked
L2(36) = which wall to draw?
L2(37) = big eyeball teleport? 0 = no, 1 = yes
L2(38) = holds the value of the monster whose turn it is. used for destroy item
L2(39) = love scene starting contrast

	MirageOS is not recommended (test this, however).
