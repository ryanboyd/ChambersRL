This is the full source code, and the full history of the source code, for [ChambersRL](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/452/45229.html) (i.e., "Chambers, the Roguelike").

This repo contains the evolving source code from every step of development of the game, as well as the compiled versions at various stages, screenshots, design documents (including descriptions of features that were never implemented).

I avoided releasing the source code for ChambersRL for a few years because, as is often the case with roguelikes, I didn't want people to just cheat their way to the end. The struggle and difficulty of the game is one of its real appeals, and I wanted ample time for people to really experience it.

However, as of today, the game has been downloaded 999 times. In honor of its impending 1,000 download achievement, I've decided to release the entirety of my work on the project here.

Enjoy!

Oh, also, there's some hidden bonuses and features that were added to the game around the time of its release. Given the sheer difficulty of the game, it's likely that very, very few people ever actually met all of the challenges necessary to unlock these features. So, without further ado... the BEST ENDING CREDITS!
